Project Summary:

The scope of this project is to analyze the customer survey data of different airlines in the United States and understand the key factors affecting the low satisfaction of customers. Further, we need to understand which major factors should be focused upon in order to help the Airlines take business decisions based on the actionable insights identified and increase its revenue. In the project, the given data will go through data cleaning. After the process of data cleaning, different analysis models will be applied on the cleaned data. After this process, different kinds of visualizations will be created to identify the major factors responsible for the high and low satisfaction of customers. 

The following are the business questions that have been answered after doing this project:
1. Which airlines have most satisfied/ happy customers?  
2. Which airlines have least satisfied/ unhappy customers? 
3. Which factors influence the customer satisfaction?
